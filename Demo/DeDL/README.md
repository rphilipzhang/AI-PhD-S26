This is a demo to leverage the powerful agentic coding capability of [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/codex/) to replicate a key empirical result, i.e., Figure 7, of the paper "[Deep Learning-Based Causal Inference for Large-Scale
Combinatorial Experiments: Theory and Empirical
Evidence](https://rphilipzhang.github.io/rphilipzhang/DeDL-nonblind.pdf)". Below are the detailed procedure to finish this replication.

## 1. Preperations

Put [the paper](DeDL.pdf), [Figure 7](Figure7.png), [the open-sourced code](synthetic_experiments.ipynb), and [a text file](instructions.txt) that articulates the step-wise instructions for the replication.

## 2. Prompting to Codex

The prompt is very simple: 

```Read DeDL.pdf and following instructions.txt to replicate Figure 7 therein.```
